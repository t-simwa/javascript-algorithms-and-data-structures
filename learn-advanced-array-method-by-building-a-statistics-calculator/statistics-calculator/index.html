            The <dfn>mean</dfn> of a list of numbers is the average, calculated by
            taking the sum of all numbers and dividing that by the count of numbers.

        <!-- Placeholder to display the calculated mean. -->

        <p>
            The <dfn>median</dfn> of a list of numbers is the number that appears in
            the middle of the list, when sorted from least to greatest.
        </p>
        <!-- Explanation of the median calculation. -->

        <p class="bold">Median: <span id="median"></span></p>

        <p>
            The <dfn>mode</dfn> of a list of numbers is the number that appears most
            often in the list.
